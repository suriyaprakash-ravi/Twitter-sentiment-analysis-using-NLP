Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning
This project is a sentiment analysis model developed using Python for analyzing sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of tweets collected from Twitter's API. The dataset contains a collection of tweets along with their associated labels (positive, negative, or neutral) obtained from manual annotations or sentiment analysis tools.

Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the project:

Python 3.7 or above
pandas 1.2.4 or above
numpy 1.19.3 or above
scikit-learn 0.24.2 or above
nltk 3.6.5 or above
matplotlib 3.3.4 or above
Usage

Install the required dependencies using pip or conda package manager.
Run the twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or any other Python IDE of your choice.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the tweets, extract features, and train the sentiment analysis model.
Optionally, you can use the trained model to make sentiment predictions on new tweets by modifying the code in the notebook.
Model Evaluation
The project uses a supervised machine learning approach to train the sentiment analysis model. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and the model is evaluated using common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix AUROC. These metrics are reported in the notebook to assess the performance of the model.

Results
The trained sentiment analysis model achieves an accuracy of around 78% on the test data, with AUROC 0.84 for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. These results indicate that the model is able to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets.

Conclusion
In this project, a sentiment analysis model was developed using Python for analyzing sentiment of tweets using NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project can be further improved by experimenting with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve better performance. The code and results can be found in the twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook in this repository.
